# News_Category_Prediction
This is a project that I did during quarantine which predicts the category of a news headline. 
It currently has 5 categories- sports, entertainment, tech, business, medical.

I have combined Headlines, food reviews, etc from different sources for these categories.

Some datasets had number of words > 20 and some had < 10. So I had to search for different datasets.

The new headline dataset by Risabh Misra has a lot of headlines but the categories are not always correct.
It was vital for the project to manually read and pick all the sentences.
